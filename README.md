This project is a solution to the "QR Code Component" challenge offered by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge was to create a responsive QR code card using HTML and CSS. The QR code card serves as a promotional element that encourages users to improve their front-end skills by building projects.

## Description

The QR code card is a simple and elegant component that displays an enticing image along with a descriptive text. It uses the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts for a visually appealing text layout. The card is designed to be responsive and works seamlessly across various devices.

The main container holds two sub-containers: the image container and the description container. The image container displays a QR code generated for a specific purpose, such as visiting Frontend Mentor's website. The description container provides relevant information about the QR code's purpose, encouraging users to scan the code and take their coding skills to the next level.
